        <h1> Mission & Vision</h1>
        <p>
            Mission:
            To create a safer learning environment by equipping schools and colleges with structured disaster
            preparedness education, practical training modules, and digital tools for emergency response.

            Vision:
            A future where every student, teacher, and institution in India is resilient, aware, and capable of
            responding effectively to natural and man-made disasters, thereby minimizing loss of life, injury, and
            panic.

        <h1>❓ Why Disaster Education is Needed</h1>
        <p>
            Lack of Awareness: Many schools and colleges are not fully aware of emergency procedures for disasters like
            earthquakes, floods, or fires.

            Unprepared Infrastructure: While guidelines exist, institutions often lack structured drills, training, and
            accessible resources.

            High Vulnerability: Students are among the most vulnerable groups during disasters. Training them increases
            overall community preparedness.

            Real-Life Examples:

            Earthquakes in Himalayan states have affected schools severely.

            Floods in Assam, Kerala, and Bihar disrupt education and put lives at risk.

            Fire accidents in schools have led to tragic losses due to lack of fire safety training.

            Educational Responsibility: Preparing students is as important as teaching academics. Disaster education
            builds resilience, confidence, and survival skills.
